# üêù 3 months of work for 3 days of code
(Okay it was more like 5 months of work but that didn't seem as poetic)

**In late October,** we connected with the head of Girls Scouts STEM in New York and started exploring a potential collaboration; we wanted something student-led for girl scouts that had something to do with coding, so a hackathon was an obvious contender!

**In January,** dozens of emails and meetings after, we confirmed the venue, date and overall vision for the event! So we started our search for Hack Clubbers that we could work with on this. Due to the small size of the event, instead of a public invitation, we reached out to some female and nonbinary Hack Clubbers we wanted to connect with and could help make the experience magical. There were so many more Hack Clubbers we wanted to invite but couldn't due to budget and venue size constraints :(

At the same time, we conceptualized the idea of a dinner with leaders, potentially one of many in the future and started inviting guests within our network and also cold emailing others!

**Things ramped up in late February** as we counted down weeks until the event, and everyone went into full Horizon mode, booking transportation, finalising the day-off schedule, dinner guests, and more!

Overall, our team of 15 probably put in almost 100 hours worth of work in meetings, discussions, and more! For me (@bellesea)[https://github.com/bellesea], it was so worth the spark of joy that I saw on the faces of many of the girl scouts and can't wait to do it all over again!
