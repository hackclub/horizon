**Successes**

- Hack Clubbers advanced technically and improved their coding skills while building friendships with other Hack Clubbers.
- Hack Clubbers learned life and professional skills, including soft skills.
- Hack Club reached low-income, underserved girls.
- Hack Club inspired Hack Clubbers to host more events, potentially reaching 250 more technical Hack Clubbers in the next 6 months.

**Lessons Learned**

- Service projects are a great way to reinforce coding skills, and Hack Clubbers love them.
- Social time together built friendships, loyalty, and collaborations, and exposed Hack Clubbers to those from different backgrounds.
- Hack Clubbers like meeting mentors and wanted more training on soft skills and etiquette.
- Mentors can be very impactful and inspiring, and 2:1 mentoring at hackathons was great.
- Hack Clubbers leading the event matters, and it is important to develop leadership skills.
- Hack Club can broaden its reach via partnerships with Girls Who Code/Girl Scouts.
- Too many adults in the room (from Girl Scouts) can be annoying.
- Less than 20 Hack Clubbers is just the right size group for traveling and keeping a small group dynamic over 48 hours.
- Ownership matters: Giving Hack Clubbers the ability to have leadership and own tasks.

**Areas to Improve**

- Hack Club needs a solid flow or next step for Girl Scouts in their technical journey.
- There is no solid flow for mentors to donate.
- Hack Clubbers need a way to recreate this experience.
- Figuring out how to not exclude or have this be 25% boys.
- Workshops need more support to be better, and concepts didn’t work.
- More older participants (8th and up) would be better.
- Hack Club needs to figure out what to do when partner orgs bring attendees who don’t want to be there.
- Clearly communicate the goals and give direction at the beginning.

**What Success Looks Like**

One year from now, Spring 2024, Hack Club will have 200 highly technical high school girls (up from 25) active at Hack Club, making up about 30% of the overall community. They will be running clubs and events, mentoring other girls, and collaborating on projects with GitHub.

**Final thoughts:**
A core mission of Hack Club is to support teenagers from every background rise into leadership roles by helping them 1. Acquire strong technical skills 2. Hold an optimistic, can-do attitude, and 3. Establish a network of friends to work with. 
These are foundational Hack Club goals.

Horizon advanced this mission for Hack Clubbers. Service projects for others is a motivating activity and makes learning different technical skills feel relevant, inspiring and real for them. 

Hack Club has not yet been able to truly reach the deeply underserved as the barriers to those kids are insane. Through a partnership with Girl Scouts STEM program, many of those barriers were overcome, including: outreach to low-income families, breakfast provided, safety via troop leader volunteers, a safe and easily accessible location, trusted faces, extra laptops and motivation via their gold projects. Rather than require they do a “new thing” Hack Club met them where they were already at, but being underserved. This approach works with GWC and FIRST and other youth groups

Mentoring and community helped overcome barriers specific to girls and nonbinary students. Horizon’s design created a new space on the slack which was way more supportive (not competitive like the code channel), where girls and non binary led, and felt supported and valued; girls and non binary students served as role models for each other; and met even greater role models with the women CEOS.

Hack Clubbers value advice and guidance from female and non binary leaders. We found having a 2:1 ratio of Hack Clubbers to leaders is crucial, as it creates an environment where Hack Clubbers feel comfortable and supported. In order to foster a sense of inclusivity and empowerment, it's important to ensure that there are no individuals present who do not align with the goals and values of the group. By prioritizing the input and experiences of female and non binary leaders, we can create a space that truly empowers Hack Clubbers and helps them to reach their full potential. Hosting an event in a home or personal space is key; rather than at a restaurant or corporate office.
