**Successes**

- Hack Clubbers advanced technically and improved their coding skills while building friendships with other Hack Clubbers.
- Hack Clubbers learned life and professional skills, including soft skills.
- Hack Club reached low-income, underserved girls.
- Hack Club inspired Hack Clubbers to host more events, potentially reaching 250 more technical Hack Clubbers in the next 6 months.

**Lessons Learned**

- Service projects are a great way to reinforce coding skills, and Hack Clubbers love them.
- Social time together built friendships, loyalty, and collaborations, and exposed Hack Clubbers to those from different backgrounds.
- Hack Clubbers like meeting mentors and wanted more training on soft skills and etiquette.
- Mentors can be very impactful and inspiring, and 2:1 mentoring at hackathons was great.
- Hack Clubbers leading the event matters, and it is important to develop leadership skills.
- Hack Club can broaden its reach via partnerships with Girls Who Code/Girl Scouts.
- Too many adults in the room (from Girl Scouts) can be annoying.
- Less than 20 Hack Clubbers is just the right size group for traveling and keeping a small group dynamic over 48 hours.
- Ownership matters: Giving Hack Clubbers the ability to have leadership and own tasks.

**Areas to Improve**

- Hack Club needs a solid flow or next step for Girl Scouts in their technical journey.
- There is no solid flow for mentors to donate.
- Hack Clubbers need a way to recreate this experience.
- Figuring out how to not exclude or have this be 25% boys.
- Workshops need more support to be better, and concepts didn’t work.
- More older participants (8th and up) would be better.
- Hack Club needs to figure out what to do when partner orgs bring attendees who don’t want to be there.
- Clearly communicate the goals and give direction at the beginning.

**What Success Looks Like**

One year from now, Spring 2024, Hack Club will have 200 highly technical high school girls (up from 25) active at Hack Club, making up about 30% of the overall community. They will be running clubs and events, mentoring other girls, and collaborating on projects with GitHub.
