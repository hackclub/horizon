# Friday March 24th

## MoMath (National Museum of Mathematics)
- On Friday morning, we stopped by MoMath for around half an hour. There were plenty of vibrant elementary school students on a field trip, changing the math sculpture illusions, riding around on bikes with square wheels, and creating complex 3D shapes from basic ones. MoMath's exhibits are split between their two floors and feels like an intimate yet creative space for tinkering.

## Girls Who Code CodeFair
- We continued Friday by visiting Girls Who Code's CodeFair in honor of their tenth anniversary. We were lucky enough to chat with Girls Who Code's CEO, Dr. Tarika Barrett. She shared her initial thoughts about taking the role of CEO, as she always felt like she was more of a "behind the scenes" person. The pressure of taking what someone else founded to the next level made it large shoes to fill. She believed organizing CodeFair was her way of sharing STEM with more underrepresented genders.
- Then we got to explore all the immersive activities. On the ground floor there was Cyber HQ to learn about keeping personal information safe, color code your vibe like a polaroid, and the girls gaming lounge to see representation in gamers. Downstairs there was an NFT art studio to create new female icons, Swift Playgrounds workshops, and a metaverse disco. Overall, there was a lot to see and play with and is a colorful introduction to all aspects of computer science.
