## MoMath (National Museum of Mathematics)
- On Friday morning, we stopped by MoMath for around half an hour. There were plenty of vibrant elementary school students on a field trip, changing the math sculpture illusions, riding around on bikes with square wheels, and creating complex 3D shapes from basic ones. MoMath's exhibits are split between their two floors and feels like an intimate yet creative space for tinkering.
