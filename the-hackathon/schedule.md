# The Schedule
We ended up finalizing the schedule the day of the event, but we had the general idea at least a week before. [@audreyolafz](https://github.com/audreyolafz), [@tiredbread](https://github.com/tiredbread), and I worked on the initial draft of the schedule together. [@belle](https://github.com/bellesea) and I worked on the final draft together in the "situation room!" ü§™

## Making the First Draft
Before we could even draft the schedule, we had to decide when the workshops were taking place. Initially, our workshop plan looked like this: 

| Time        | ‚ÄúBeginner‚Äôs track‚Äù | Cool stuff           |
|-------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| 10:00-11:00 | Web Dev 1          | Sprig                |
| 11:00-11:45 | GitHub             | AdaFruit / Hardware  |
| 1:00-1:45   | Generative Art     | Web Dev 2            |

We each contacted the workshop hosts to confirm their workshop times and details. 

It didn't look like any changes needed to be made, but we did change some of the names. 

From there, we revolved the schedule around the workshops, opening time, and closing time.

| Time         | Event                                                                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 9 -  9:30a   | Check-in                                                                 |
| 9:30 - 10    | Event Starts                                                             |

| 11 - 11:45a  | GITHUB (Keira, Adelina, Aileen, Ava) and DIY JEOPARDY (Lorelai, Jasmina) |
| 12 - 1p      | Lunch Break!                                                             |
| 1 - 1:45p    | GENERATIVE ART (Claire) and WEB DEV 2 (Audrey, Maggie)                   |
| 4 - 5:15p    | Project Showcase                                                         |
| 5:15 - 5:30p | Closing                                                                  |

Now we have something to start with!

We needed some time for some fun team-building activities and brain breaks, but we didn't have those finalized until Friday night and Saturday morning.

We knew one activity we wanted to do was cup stacking - where teams have a single rubber band with four strings attached, and they have to successfully stack their cups just by pulling on the strings.

We had a couple ideas for another fun activity at 2pm, but decided to leave 2:30 - 4pm for extra coding time.

I styled our document for easier viewing üòâ, moved around some of the times, and ended up with this as our first iteration!

## Finalizing at the Hackathon
We did end up only finalizing the actual schedule and printing it out the morning of, but we had a meeting on Friday night to discuss.

All of the Hack Clubbers sat around a table to discuss the schedule. [@christinaasquith](https://github.com/christinaasquith) mentioned that our schedule looked too tight to be manageable, and we received feedback from everyone about the fun activities we proposed:

- Cookie Eating Contest
- Just Dance
- Dance Formation Challenge
- Orpheus Balancing

along with ideas for the project showcase.

- Lightning Pitches
- Slack Ships
- Cookie Voting (each cookie = superlative)

We ended up doing Just Dance and a game where groups need to keep the balloon in the air the longest, with our limited timeframe.

For the project showcase, we ended up deciding that each team had one slide on a shared Google Slides to promote their project prior to a gallery walk.

I then moved around some of the times to leave some breathing room in between activities and workshops. Each workshop had a hard stop 5 minutes before the half-hour to ensure participants could get to the next activity.

### Naming the Rooms
We also had to name the rooms where each activity/workshop was taking place. We wanted them to be more fun than just "Conference Room 1" so we named each Conference Room after a building in NYC. 

## Ready to Print!

I looked it over with Belle, and the schedule was ready to print!
