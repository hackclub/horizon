On March 25th, we celebrated a magical day of coding organized in collaboration with the Girls Scouts of Greater New York. It was held in their offices, and we all arrived a day early to help [set up the space](https://github.com/hackclub/horizon/blob/main/the-hackathon/venue-setup.md). Our goal was to turn 

The day off, we started check-ins around 8:45am and transitioned to short opening-ceremony and games, and immediately moved to coding time (with workshops sprinkled in-between). A more in-depth 🗓️ schedule can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WqOv9DJBwcu6ehXNx9zg8NGj-ulp1OAVXp0HlYCeqcY/edit).

### 👩🏽‍💻 Participants
We had 37 girl scouts — most of whom had never coded — and 18 more advanced high school coders to serve as peer mentors, some of them also led the workshops! This ratio worked out really well as it made sure every girl that needed support got what they needed without the event feeling like a classroom :)

### 🧙🏼‍♀️ Staffing
We had the support of 5 Girl Scouts of Greater New York staff, 5 volunteers, and 3 adults from the Hack Club team to help maintain a safe environment. We also had a few experienced engineers join throughout the day as mentors.

### 💻 Projects 
Since this was a beginner's hackathon, we focused on helping everyone build a project rather than compete for a prize which culminated in a science-fair like showcase with optional presentations at the end of the day. We had people build a fashion blog, website on their favourite things, game about their younger siblings, and more! It was truly incredible to write code that they could feel proud of and continue working on after the event!
