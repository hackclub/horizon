# ðŸš¢ Project Showcase 
We came up with the project showcase plan the night before the event, which was to have a single Google Slides presentation where each team was allotted one slide to "promote" their project in front of everyone in the Horizon Room where a gallery walk took place.

## Initial Ideas
Our initial goal for the project showcase was to use cookies as a voting implement. We wanted some superlatives that were represented by a type of Girl Scout cookie where the Girl Scouts could use a cookie to cast their "vote" for a superlative.

Our idea morphed into giving each team their own cookie jar and then having a gallery walk where each participant voted by placing a cookie corresponding to a superlative into the project's jar.

## Final Plan
While discussing the schedule the night before the event, we realized that having a project showcase like the one mentioned above would be too time-consuming and stressful given our limited timeframe.

We had to come up with some ideas:

- A gallery walk
- Lightning pitches
- Everyone presents their own slideshow

We decided to combine all of these ideas into one!

I created a Google Slides presentation with instructions for the Girl Scouts to use one slide for their project.

We then created a [hack.af](hack.af) link for the slideshow, which we wrote up on the whiteboards.

## The Showcase
Around 4:15pm, we had to set up the tables for the gallery walk. We created a "science fair" style walk where the participants would stand behind the table and have their computer face the viewers. 

We had everyone's slides ready to go, and presented them on the projector screen. Each participant was called to quickly describe their project.

The gallery walk was AMAZING âœ¨ and everyone's projects were wonderful.
