At Horizon, the Hack Clubbers that attended hosted workshops for the Girl Scouts :) With workshops, we wanted to accomplish a few goals:
- introduce the participants to the possibilities with code
- give them skills to contribute to building their hackathon project

### We offered a total of 5 worshops:

_We intentionally named these workshops with non technical terms to make them easy to understand_

Not all of us had experience running workshops so managing a room with a variety of experience was challenging and in the future, we'd work on polishing a few great beginner workshops (potentially even adding handouts etc.) to improve the experience but overall, accomplished these goals as all the attendees joined at least one workshop and were able to showcase a project in the end, despite not having any prior coding experience!
