Good evening, everyone. 

I am thrilled and grateful to have you all here tonight. I am Abby Fischler, a 16-year-old junior, and I attend Geffen Academy at UCLA in Los Angeles. From a young age, I have always been interested in technology. From attending typing workshops, to STEM classes, to a summer spent at Stanford learning about Cyber Security and countless hours working with my FIRST robotics team technology has become my passion. 

In 2021, I went on the Hacker Zephyr Train, this was Hack Club’s summer program where myself and 42 other teenagers from around the world coded on a train across the United States for a week. This adventure was very meaningful and life changing. I had befriended a community of others my age who loved to code and I discovered tools to make real things. Great things came after the trip as well. For example I was able to co host an Ask Me Anything for Hack Club with Gwynne Shotwell the president of SpaceX. 

These experiences inspired my CS journey and I am grateful for all the support Hack Club Has provided me. At Hack Club, we all share a passion for coding, yet as girls and nonbinary individuals, we can sometimes feel isolated and underrepresented in the tech world. We don't often see people like us in prominent positions of leadership.

Tonight, I am here to talk about a vision that Christina and I had on the train trip: to create a community where we would see more diversity in the tech field. You are here with us tonight making this a reality. It's so inspiring to see you in these roles and makes me feel like I can do it too one day.

Today, we spent the day coding alongside Girl Scouts at a Hackathon or as I describe to my grandparents a “coding party.” We ran coding workshops for Girl Scouts of Greater New York, to help make technical education accessible to all young people, regardless of means. 

I have organized this dinner tonight for the first of hopefully many special events at  Hack Club. Tonight is an authentic example of realizing dreams and building communities where diversity in technology is celebrated.

Mentorship is so important, and I feel so fortunate to have wonderful mentors and to have felt supported in my journey. I hope this event will be an opportunity for everyone here to benefit from such great leaders around the room. 

I want to take a brief moment for a few thank yous:
- First: To all the girls, from all the zoom calls to thousands of slack messages to planning Horizon, this weekend has been a dream come true. So lucky to have met you all.
- Second, Belle, I couldn’t have imagined doing this with anyone else. As we have said a zillion times throughout this, we get each other and work so well. I”m grateful for you and all we have done.
- And of course Chrisitna, meeting you on the Zephyr trip changed my life. I couldn’t be more grateful. Thank you for trusting me and guiding me. I am so happy tonight has finally happened.

Thank you all.
