Good afternoon,



On behalf of Hack Club cofounder Christina Asquith and all 14 of the teenage organizers, we are so thrilled you’re joining us next Saturday (3/25) at LOCATION. 



Hack Club is one of the largest coding organizations in the world for technical teens from around the world who love to code. At Hack Club, we all share a passion for coding, yet as girls and nonbinary individuals, we can sometimes feel isolated and underrepresented in the tech world. We don't often see people like us in prominent positions of leadership. We are very excited to meet each other in person for the first time next weekend, and to spend the day Saturday running free coding workshops for Girl Scouts of Greater New York— to help make technical education accessible to all young people, regardless of means. And we are very excited then to meet you all, to hear about your work and to share what we coded that day! 



We designed this event to be informal and relaxed- with the hopes of creating opportunities for real conversation between the 35 of us in attendance. There will be a brief introduction and we would love it if you introduced yourself but please don’t feel any need to prepare anything. To that end, we have compiled a document with everyone’s short bios so you can see in advance who is attending and learn a little bit more about who we are and what we have been coding at Hack Club. 



Our agenda for the evening:

7:15 pm - Arrival
7:30 pm - Introductions and shared conversations
8:00 pm - Buffet dinner and mingling
This is the first time we have run an event like this at Hack Club and it is the culmination of a dream that I’ve been talking about with Christina since I was 13– which is to create a community where we see more diversity in tech.



Hack Club values transparency, to that end we open source everything. Here is a link to our GitHub repo, and a link to Hack Club Bank, where we run our finances transparently so that every teenager can learn how to budget and run events like this. Founded by a teenage engineer in 2014, thousands of teenagers now learn to code in Hack Club’s free programs each year.



Thank you for helping make this happen for me and all the girls at Hack Club. Please reach out if you have any questions. Have a nice weekend!



All the best,

Abby Fischler
