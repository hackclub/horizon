Our event provided a platform for Hack Clubbers and aspiring female and non-binary leaders to discuss coding, career opportunities, and the challenges faced as gender minorities in the workplace. We strongly believe that having a female mentor and role model can be crucial in helping Hack Clubbers achieve success.

The dinner was about 30 guests, including 18 teenagers and [8 special guests](/dinner/guestlist.md). The dinner hosted by Abby Fischler, Belle See and Christina Asquith, a former war journalist and lifelong women’s rights activist and cofounder of Hack Club at a friend of Hack Club’s apartments multipurpose room. We brought decorations to make the space great for the event!
