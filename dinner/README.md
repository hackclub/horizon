We hosted an event for Hack Clubbers and inspiring female and non-binary leaders to converse about coding, careers and being a gender minority in the workplace. We believe that having a female mentor and role model is key to helping Hack Clubbers succeed.

The dinner was about 30 guests, including 18 teenagers and [8 special guests](/dinner/guestlist.md). The dinner hosted by Abby Fischler, Belle See and Christina Asquith, a former war journalist and lifelong women’s rights activist and cofounder of Hack Club at a friend of Hack Club’s apartments multipurpose room.
