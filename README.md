![Horizon ~ 24th March to 26 March](https://cloud-4b5ejv320-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0horizon_banner.png)

## ‚ú® The Overview
Horizon was [Hack Club's](https://hackclub.com/) first all-female/nonbinary hackathon weekend! Led by Hack Clubbers, it included 20 girls from Hack Club, plus 37 girls from Girl Scouts. From March 24th - March 26th 18 technical high school girls from Hack Club hosted a free, 1-day hackathon with Girl Scouts of Greater NY. It included 4 workshops in making websites in html and css, creating a video game in JavaScript, and much more. We did 8 hours of coding total and the girls built their first real coding projects.

The goal of this repository is to be a reference for high schoolers looking to organise their own hackathon / events with Girl Scouts. his repository is our digital footprint of this event, we hope this will serve as inspiration for future events.

## üéØ The Weekend
| Day | Activity                                                                 |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Fri üèôÔ∏è | We toured NYC, visited Girls Who Code‚Äôs CodeFair, Math Museum, set up the hackathon, and had a team sync and dinner together.|
|SaturDAY üíª |We ran a 1-day, 8-hour hackathon for 37 Girl Scouts ages 11-16, which included 4 workshops and hours of coding. |
|Saturday night üç¥ |Saturday night we hosted a dinner with 10 female and nonbinary leaders, CEOs and engineers (Sara Chipps, Jessica Rovello, Stacey Cunningham, Rachel Lim, Julia Haart, Pinky Dewani, Christina Entcheva, Trina Spear, Lachlan Campbell, Meredith Maskara)|
|Sun üçµ  | We debriefed over breakfast, went to a bookshop and enjoyed NYC!  |


## üéØ The Goal
1. ** TECHNICAL: ** The first was to support Hack Clubbers to become more technical, to become better leaders, and to deepen friendships through collaborative coding projects.
2. ** GROWTH: **The second goal was to grow Hack Club‚Äôs community so it is inclusive and accessible to teenagers of all backgrounds. We made active outreach to under-represented, less-advantaged young people, including girls and girls of color, who don‚Äôt have computer science programs or professional mentors in their community.


## üí∏ The Budget

Horizon had a budget of \$18,000. HS hackathon budgets can range anywhere from \$500 to \$75,000. Whatever your budget is, you'll find a similar set of expenses will arise between all hackathons. Every expense made for Horizon has been open sourced [here](https://bank.hackclub.com/horizon) through Hack Club Bank's [transparency mode](https://headwayapp.co/bank-changelog/transparent-finances-optional-feature-151427)
