![Horizon ~ 24th March to 26 March](https://cloud-4b5ejv320-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0horizon_banner.png)

## ‚ú® The Overview
Horizon was [Hack Club's](https://hackclub.com/) first all-female/nonbinary hackathon weekend! From 24th - March 26th, 18 Hack Clubbers from the US gathered in New York City to host a 1-day hackathon with Girl Scouts of Greater NY where 37 Girl Scouts wrote  their first line of code! It included 4 workshops in building websites, creating a video game in JavaScript, and much more. After the hackathon, Hack Clubbers hosted a dinner with incredible female leaders. 

The goal of this repository is to be a reference for high schoolers looking to organise their own beginner-focused hackathon and corresponding dinner. This is our digital footprint of this event, we hope this will serve as inspiration for future events.

## üéØ The Weekend
A rundown of what we did in New York City!

| Day | Activity                                                                 |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Fri üèôÔ∏è | We toured NYC, visited Girls Who Code‚Äôs CodeFair, Math Museum, set up the hackathon, and had a team sync and dinner together.|
|Sat üíª | We ran a 1-day, 8-hour hackathon for 37 Girl Scouts ages 11-16, which included 4 workshops and hours of coding. |
|Saturday night üç¥ | Saturday night we hosted a dinner with 10 female and nonbinary leaders, CEOs and engineers |
|Sun üçµ  | We debriefed over breakfast, went to a bookshop and enjoyed NYC!  |


## üéØ The Goal
We came into this weekend with 2 goals:
1. To support Hack Clubbers to become more technical, to become better leaders, and to deepen friendships through collaborative coding projects.
2. To grow Hack Club‚Äôs community so it is inclusive and accessible to teenagers of all backgrounds. We made active outreach to under-represented, less-advantaged young people, including girls and girls of color, who don‚Äôt have computer science programs or professional mentors in their community.

## üí∏ The Budget

[![](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbank-shields.hackclub.com%2Forganizations%2Fhorizon%2Fbalance)](https://bank.hackclub.com/horizon)

Horizon had a budget of $19,000 with an approximate breakdown of
| Item | Amount ($) |
|------|--------|
|‚úàÔ∏è Travel Stipends| 6,000 |
|üè® Hotel | 5,200 |
|ü•ò Dinner | 3,500 |
|ü•ò Weekend expenses | 2,300 |
|üëö Hackathon: Swag, Decorations, workshops | 2,000 |

HS hackathon budgets can range anywhere from \$500 to \$75,000. Horizon was our first time organizing such event and if repeated, keeping the attendees local would be able to bring the costs down to around $5,000 or even less!

Every expense made for Horizon has been open sourced [here](https://bank.hackclub.com/horizon) through Hack Club Bank's [transparency mode](https://headwayapp.co/bank-changelog/transparent-finances-optional-feature-151427)
