The Vision: On March 25th 2023, Girl Scouts will gather in NYC for a day of coding and tinkering with creative projects to share with the world.

Horizon is a collaboration between Hack Club and the Girl Scouts of Greater NY. This repository shows all of the behind the scenes in making Horizon come alive.
